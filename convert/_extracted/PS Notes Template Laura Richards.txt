Notes on Police Disclosure

Concerned in the supply.

Based on intel – drug dealing and kids in the flat.

Been to the flat….found him outside – seized his phone.  Nothing of note in the flat.  Girlfriend had some weed which she said was hers.

Does not want to give the pin.

Class A.

Activity round there of late.

Acted on further information today – surveillance.  We park our cars around there.

Interview and RUI.

Significant comments? No

Not really known to police.






Client Instructions:

Statement of: 

CJA 1967 S.9, MCA 1980 S.5A and 5B, CPR rule 27.2


 
Not dealing Class A.  Only thing they will find on the phone is some sharing weed with friends/messages asking if I want to a smoke.  I did have some pills in the flat ready for a rave in a few weeks.  About 8 MDMA pills.

I think this is to do with my association with someone that comes round for a smoke.  He is a drug dealer on licence.

I am not willing to give my pin to the phone.

Advice – no comment interview so as to avoid adding to evidence – they do not have any at the present time.  Phone will take upwards of 12 weeks to be looked at. He will be RUI’d
