ATTENDING & ADVISING CLIENT PRIOR TO FIRST INTERVIEW (Cont)
CLIENT’S INSTRUCTIONS:-   


If I tell the truth then im putting my life at risk, as Manjinder and his family will cause me harm.

Manjinder has a phone in prison and he calls me all the time and tells me to do things and if I don’t then im at risk.

I had my car taken off me and other things.

Manjinder and Paige were in a relationship but I was in a relationship with Manjinder b4 Paige and they only got together to get at me.

Manjinder’s sols came to me and asked me if these mgs were real or fake and I said im not getting involved into anything.

Manjinder forced me to make these messages and threatened me to do things and blackmailed me if I don’t do things he will hurt me, my children and the dog.

I feel that I have been put under duress by Manjinder and his family to do these messages because if I refused I would assaulted.

I have been a victim of assault by Manjinder throughout the relationship and controlled by him.

Manjinder still rings me from Prison and I have to be sweet with them in order to avoid any repercussions.

The messages are FB are fake and the screenshots of FB are genuine.

LEGAL REPRES:	SA	 		INTERPRETER:
CAUTION GIVEN: Yes	(Details if appropriate): -

 Officer goes through the allegation of fabricated messages.  PTCJ – explained what it means

Exhibit of messages shown – Are these fabricated

Yes but not all of them.
Manjinder made up this account and forced me to do things, as I’m petrified what he does.
Client mentions the abuse she has suffered from Manjinder 

I only sent these to the solicitor to keep safe.  Manjinder and his family have taken my car of me and money etc.  Manny calls me from prison and threatens me and forces me to do things.

These messages are fabricated by Manjinder.
Paige smashed Manny’s phone and he made this FB account on my phone.  Even though I have my own FB on the same phone.

There are no dates on these screenshots as Manny create them and made me do screenshot and send them to the solicitors.
Me and Paige were best friends but she started to have a relationship with him.

Manny went to prison in Dec and before that he used to be at mine.
He was at mine and assaulting me, the police was called and he wouldn’t let me answer the door, so they took the door down and I told the police he was hiding in the loft but don’t say I told them.

I don’t know when he created the account but he was at my house sometimes in Dec just before Christmas when he was arrested.
He was buying fake gold and selling it from my phone and the account he created to make money and for these messages.

I still love Paige she is my best friend and I still care for her, he would send me messages and tell me what to do, controlling my life.
Cant say the exact dates when these messages were created and sent.

The screenshot of messages – Manny was in prison but his brother and cousin were at my front door.
The car was taken off me by his brother and cousin.  He still makes me send him money in prison, although I had different boy friends but I haven’t been so petrified by anyone other then this man.

The call is probably with Manny and the screenshot were done at control of Manny.
Manny told me what to type and how to type it as he knows how Paige used to write coz he was with her.

These messages are fabricated by Manjinder.
Paige smashed Manny’s phone and he made this FB account on my phone.  Even though I have my own FB on the same phone.

There are no dates on these screenshots as Manny create them and made me do screenshot and send them to the solicitors.
Me and Paige were best friends but she started to have a relationship with him.

Manny went to prison in Dec and before that he used to be at mine.
He was at mine and assaulting me, the police was called and he wouldn’t let me answer the door, so they took the door down and I told the police he was hiding in the loft but don’t say I told them.

I don’t know when he created the account but he was at my house sometimes in Dec just before Christmas when he was arrested.
He was buying fake gold and selling it from my phone and the account he created to make money and for these messages.

I still love Paige she is my best friend and I still care for her, he would send me messages and tell me what to do, controlling my life.
Cant say the exact dates when these messages were created and sent.

The screenshot of messages – Manny was in prison but his brother and cousin were at my front door.
The car was taken off me by his brother and cousin.  He still makes me send him money in prison, although I had different boy friends but I haven’t been so petrified by anyone other then this man.

The call is probably with Manny and the screenshot were done at control of Manny.
Manny told me what to type and how to type it as he knows how Paige used to write coz he was with her.  
INTERVIEW(S) OF CLIENT (cont)
I told them I don’t want anything to do with these messages which I told the sols.
These messages were sent to sols in Jan and I hadn’t heard from them since until last week when the sols came to my address out of blue.  I told her I was gonna tell the police the truth of Manny’s behaviour.

Paige has asked me for money as she is crack head – even though these are fabricated.
Its true she posted that she was gonna post my nude of FB, I reported that to the police.

Iphone 15 pro-mac – I think its smashed from the back.
No other device used except this – no pin code its all zero’s x6

Although I was in physical possession of the phone, but Manny would either be on the phone or next to me telling exactly what to write.
I did screenshot but they must have recently found them.

I told the sols I don’t want them to be used I court.  I know his a women beater but he didn’t rape her.
I was upset coz I loved him and I love Paige as well.
Told Manny that Paige set him up to get him robbed. I gave Manny’s address to Paige and the next day he was robbed.  He blamed me but I told him it was Paige who had it done.
This is the 5th person she has accused of Rape, and there have been 2 other people since after Manny.  No1 believe her as she cries wolf too often.
I know Manny is a women beater but a Rapist that’s not Manny.  He is type of man who would use violence.
Once they broke up she messaged me and told be they broke up.
Paige was with him when he broke windows of my house.
He would come down after he broke up with Paige.  Even after all the shit they put me through I still feel for them.
I don’t know why I allowed him back in my life but I wouldn’t say we were in a relationship anymore.  He was at my house put a knife to me placed me in a corner and the police came and he was arrested to which I was glad, I didn’t want him anymore.
Have reported Manny’s controlling behaviour to police, but have to keep him sweet to avoid any further repercussions.
When sending these messages to sols, Manny in prison, and his brother and cousin would come and threaten me, make my life hell. 
I feel I have put my own life at risk for that slag and that piece of shit both of whom have ruined my life.
Spoke to family and friends about abuse – Laura, Wallace, my brother, mum and it was plastered all over FB. I put that cos Paige was blasting me on FB so I put that on and she was my best and I couldn’t handle it so posted it to show what he was really like.
Mentions about when she was stabbed on her b’day last year.

IV concluded 21.11
