CLIENTS INSTRUCTIONS


I KELI-MAY DAWSON (DOB:  06/04/74 ) confirm that my legal representative from Riaz Law Solicitors has fully advised me of my rights and entitlements whilst attending the police station. My legal representative has also fully advised me of the offence(s) and the detail(s) of the allegation(s) against me.

I neither admit nor deny the allegations made against me, I cannot recall if I sent him a message or not.  I do have a Facebook account in the name of Keli May McClay, however, I haven’t used it in a while.  No one else has access to my account and I don’t believe my account has been hacked.  I understand that there is a RO in place against me, restricting me from contacting Andrew MCCLAY.  I will be conducting a No Comment interview.


_______________________________________________________________________________

I agree that these are my instructions: 

Signed:_____ ________

Print Name: ___    KELI-MAY DAWSON     ___

Dated: ______31/08/25________



Police Caution

	•	“You do not have to say anything”
	•	Advise that the client has a legal right not to say anything – they are under no legal option to provide any answers or any responses to any and/or all questions asked.

	•	“But it may harm you defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on on Court”
	•	Advise that should the client answer no comment to questions in interview and subsequently give an account in court, or should the client give an account in interview and that account changes in court, the account may be less likely to be believed. – an adverse inference can be drawn by the Court if questions are not answered, and they may be less inclined to believe the client as they may believe that he has time to concoct a false story.

	•	“Anything you do say may be given in evidence”
	•	The interview will be audio/visually-recorded and can be played in court if necessary; or a transcript may be prepared and read out in Court if necessary.

Has Legal Representative Fully Explained the Caution: Yes [✓ ] / No [   ]
Advise Client of the Options

	•	‘No comment’:                Yes [✓ ] / No [   ] / NA [   ]

	•	Answer questions:         Yes [✓ ] / No [   ] / NA [   ]

	•	Prepared Statement:      Yes [✓ ] / No [   ] / NA [   ]
Advice to client on basis on instructions provided:

I explained to the client my role, duty of confidentiality, rights/entitlements, the police allegation, the interview procedure, the caution, the “no comment”/prepared statement interview options, the special warning that may be administered in interview, bad character, dangerousness (if appliable).

I have further explained my ethical position and the criminal burden of proof.  I have discussed any immediate concerns, medical issues, and injuries the client may have.  

I have given advice on the detention time limits; the standard 24 hours, reviews after the first 6 hours, then in 9-hour intervals thereon.  The 12-hour extension at authorisation of the superintendent (36 hours).  Thereafter by the Courts up to a maximum of 96 hours without action.

The legal definition of the offence was explained to the client.  All possible defences were explained in detail. – client advised if he has a valid defence, to put it forward in interview.

Client advised even if he is guilty of the alleged offence, if there is no corroborating evidence to support the prosecution’s case, then it is unlikely to yield a conviction and these circumstances, it is best to conduct a NO COMMENT interview.

Based on consultation with the client, the client was advised to: conduct a NC interview.

Client advised if he wishes to exercise his right to silence, he does so on his own accord to avoid self-incrimination or incrimination of others. The decision to answer no comment to questions, he makes of his own free will and under no pressure.  He has been advised of the implications for the same.

He has been fully advised that if this matter culminates in a charge for him to appear before the Courts. A Court my place less weight on any evidence that he gives.  If the interview is on a voluntary basis, he understands that he will have to submit his biometrics at the relevant police station at the relevant time.
Reason(s) for advice provided:

The client has neither admitted nor denied the offence.  
There is little evidence against the client.
The client cannot recall whether she sent the alleged message.
The client does not want to provide an account and wished to conduct a NC interview.


(For the Client) 

I understand the advice I have been given and have chosen to:-

	•	Follow the advice provided by my legal representative [✓ ]

	•	Having understood the advice provided, I am declining to follow this advice [    ]

Transcript
Speaker 2
And the message seems to be coming from yourself. Well, allegedly yourself talking about some family issues. What can you talk to me about now? No comment. I can see you getting quite emotional is.
Speaker 3
That I'm just reading it I. No comment.
Speaker 2
Were you trying to sort of get the family back together?
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
What are you thinking?
Speaker 3
No comment I heard rather not no comment.
Speaker 2
How does it make you feel when you're reading that? Does it? Does it make you angry? Does it No.
Speaker 3
No comment. Just no comment.
Speaker 2
You've been quite disappointed.
Speaker 3
I just like to see the next.
Speaker 2
So the next one is LP02, which is pretty much just a continuation from. The previous exhibition.
Speaker 3
No comment again.
Speaker 2
Does it still make you feel disappointed or disheartened or?
Speaker 3
No comment, I just.
Speaker 2
Do you feel quite confused about it or?
Speaker 3
Not no comment.
Speaker 2
The next one is LP03, which again is a continuation message.
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
The first time you seen these messages?
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
If it is, who would have sent them using that account?
Speaker 3
Now comment.
Speaker 2
Did you get somebody's agenda for you or? Did somebody just use your phone number? Message them that.
Speaker 3
No comment. OK.
Speaker 2
Obviously because. It's allegedly your name at the top of the messages. I can see that, yeah. People may deem it as, you know, it's coming from yourself. I buy people. I mean, the victim, alleged victim would have deemed it to be coming from yourself. So that would then mean that it's a breach of a restraining order. Are you aware of any restraining order at the moment? Against Andrew.
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
Have you been arrested for? Bone as the reason as to why there is a restraining order.
Speaker 3
No comment. OK. Do you know?
Speaker 2
Anything about this restraining order?
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
I'll show you Exhibit Alpha Mike 01. So that's the alleged restraining order. So as you can see, obviously he's got your name as the alleged suspect on there, the case references on there. And also this is going to Anbury. But as you can see, it's got the conditions on there to not contact him in pretty much any way, directly or indirectly. Have you seen this restraining order before?
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
Have you got a copy yourself of this restraining?
Speaker
Order No comment No no comment no comment.
Speaker 2
Because obviously if you haven't seen this restraining order before or you're not aware of it or anything like that. Obviously we've got that. You tell me. Again, this is a chance for you to tell me your side of the story so.
Speaker 3
There is no side, no comment. That's it.
Speaker 2
But overall, obviously I understand this is an allegation that's been made against you and obviously we have to act upon it. So if you feel like you are in the wrong, then obviously just let me know and then we can talk about it. But from seeing all this evidence, you can see the reason why. You're here. Unfortunately OK, so if there is anything that you feel is done wrongly, feel free to talk to me about it.
Speaker 3
No comment.
Speaker 2
That could be fun. OK. Have you got anything else to add? Do you like to raise or anything like that?
Speaker 3
No.
Speaker 2
That's fine. So let's say you've got everything. Got anything to add? No, thank you. Perfect. So the time is 2155 hours and I will now conclude the interview.

PRE-PREPARED STATEMENT

DATE:
TIME:
CLIENT:
POLICE STATION:
INSTRUCTING SOLICITORS:


This pre prepared statement has been scribed by Legal Representative Mr Riaz and is on my instruction.  These are my own words and is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  

Mr Riaz has explained my legal rights and the options available to me, namely that I can answer all questions and provide a full account, put forward a pre prepared statement, or conduct a no comment interview where I answer some or no questions put to me.  I understand that this is simply advice and any decision I make is of my own volition.  I understand the implications of not answering questions or answering “no comment” to questions.  This being that should the matter proceed forward, and I fail to answer a question that I could have reasonably answered here today, the court may draw an inference.

	•	I Deny the allegation(s) made against me; I have not committed the alleged offence(s). 
	•
