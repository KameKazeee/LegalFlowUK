CLIENTS INSTRUCTIONS


I Craig Johns (DOB:  07/08/94 ) confirm that my legal representative from Riaz Law Solicitors has fully advised me of my rights and entitlements whilst attending the police station. My legal representative has also fully advised me of the offence(s) and the detail(s) of the allegation(s) against me.

I deny the allegations made against me, I have no knowledge or involvement of the alleged offence.  I will be conducting a No Comment interview. – SEE PPS for further details.


_______________________________________________________________________________

I agree that these are my instructions: 

Signed:____ _________

Print Name: ___  Craig Johns       ___

Dated: _____28/09/25_________



Police Caution

	•	“You do not have to say anything”
	•	Advise that the client has a legal right not to say anything – they are under no legal option to provide any answers or any responses to any and/or all questions asked.

	•	“But it may harm you defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on on Court”
	•	Advise that should the client answer no comment to questions in interview and subsequently give an account in court, or should the client give an account in interview and that account changes in court, the account may be less likely to be believed. – an adverse inference can be drawn by the Court if questions are not answered, and they may be less inclined to believe the client as they may believe that he has time to concoct a false story.

	•	“Anything you do say may be given in evidence”
	•	The interview will be audio/visually-recorded and can be played in court if necessary; or a transcript may be prepared and read out in Court if necessary.

Has Legal Representative Fully Explained the Caution: Yes [✓ ] / No [   ]
Advise Client of the Options

	•	‘No comment’:                Yes [✓ ] / No [   ] / NA [   ]

	•	Answer questions:         Yes [✓ ] / No [   ] / NA [   ]

	•	Prepared Statement:      Yes [✓ ] / No [   ] / NA [   ]
Advice to client on basis on instructions provided:

I explained to the client my role, duty of confidentiality, rights/entitlements, the police allegation, the interview procedure, the caution, the “no comment”/prepared statement interview options, the special warning that may be administered in interview, bad character, dangerousness (if appliable).

I have further explained my ethical position and the criminal burden of proof.  I have discussed any immediate concerns, medical issues, and injuries the client may have.  

I have given advice on the detention time limits; the standard 24 hours, reviews after the first 6 hours, then in 9-hour intervals thereon.  The 12-hour extension at authorisation of the superintendent (36 hours).  Thereafter by the Courts up to a maximum of 96 hours without action.

The legal definition of the offence was explained to the client.  All possible defences were explained in detail. – client advised if he has a valid defence, to put it forward in interview.

Client advised even if he is guilty of the alleged offence, if there is no corroborating evidence to support the prosecution’s case, then it is unlikely to yield a conviction and these circumstances, it is best to conduct a NO COMMENT interview.

Based on consultation with the client, the client was advised to: put forward a PPS & to conduct a NC interview. This way he can put forward his valid defence without the fear of self-incrimination or the incrimination of another, and also can omit various elements of his account that he is under no legal obligation to disclose.

Client advised if he wishes to exercise his right to silence, he does so on his own accord to avoid self-incrimination or incrimination of others. The decision to answer no comment to questions, he makes of his own free will and under no pressure.  He has been advised of the implications for the same.

He has been fully advised that if this matter culminates in a charge for him to appear before the Courts. A Court my place less weight on any evidence that he gives.  If the interview is on a voluntary basis, he understands that he will have to submit his biometrics at the relevant police station at the relevant time.
Reason(s) for advice provided:

The client has denied the offence.  
There is little evidence against the client.
The client does not want to provide an account and wished to conduct a NC interview.


(For the Client) 

I understand the advice I have been given and have chosen to:-

	•	Follow the advice provided by my legal representative [✓ ]

	•	Having understood the advice provided, I am declining to follow this advice [    ]

Transcript
Speaker 2
To bleed and swell, OK. Umm, so it's now very important you listen to what I'm about to say. You do not have to say anything but may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you were later aligned in court. Anything you do say may be given an evidence. Do you understand what that means? Perfect.
Speaker 3
Cool is there?
Speaker 2
Anything you want to ask before we start?
Speaker 4
You know, like obviously like you took the statements out, the statements have taken last night. So when she was under the influence of alcohol, the statements were taken.
Speaker 2
OK, I I don't know if she was. Under the influence because of shell seen at work. But is that is that something you wanna?
Speaker 4
100% it is OK because that's the whole reason why I just distanced myself and just disappeared. Can be honestly arguing because like drinking and that so they put an argument somebody if you have a drink.
Speaker 2
Is it OK? So you're currently under investigation for actual bodily harm. It's been reported that you've assaulted your partner Lisa Gregson on the evening on the 27th of the 9th of 2025 by putting your hands around her throat and inviting her face within her home address. For 2 Stratford Rd, could you confirm that's her address, not yours? Stay there. Can you tell me about what happened? No comment I've.
Speaker 5
Got a pre prepared statement, would you like me to read that? Yes please. This pre prepared statement has been described by my legal representative Mr Riaz and is on my instruction. These are my own words and true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I deny the allegations made against me. I have not committed the alleged offences of Section 47 actual bodily harm assault. I can confirm that I have not assaulted Lisa Gregson in any way, shape or form on any date, at any location at any time. I can confirm that on the 27th of September 2025 I have not put my hands around. Her neck as 42 Stratford Rd. I have not restricted her breathing in any way. I have not bitten her cheek and I certainly have not attempted to damage her mobile phone in any way. I have not caused her to sustain any injuries and I certainly have not caused any cut or bruise on her elbow. I can confirm that I have not assaulted Lisa at the end of August at 42 Stratford Rd or at any other location for that matter. I have not pointed to the face. I have not caused her to sustain any injuries. I certainly have not caused her to sustain a bloody nose or any bruising to her eyes. These allegations are false. I believe that Lisa is making these false allegations, uh, due to a recent disagreement that we have had and her intoxication. I will be answering no comment to all further questions. It's digitally signed by the client and I will e-mail you a.
Speaker 2
Copy of the same. Thank you. And it's going to be frustrating, but I'm going to still ask you all the questions I've got. So what can you tell me about assistance? Do you recall the incident? No comma. How would you describe your relationship with Lisa? Has there any? Has there been any physical or verbal abuse in your relationship towards you or vice versa? What's your home address? Do you live together?
Speaker 4
Right comma.
Speaker 2
How would you describe the relationship? So it's been reported on the 27th of the 9th that you put your hands around her neck and bit her cheek as well as throwing her phone to her elbow causing bruising. Did.
Speaker 4
You do this.
Speaker 2
Have you ever assaulted her before? Why would she accuse you of this?
Speaker 4
No comments. OK.
Speaker 2
I'm just going to show you the exhibits that I've got.
Speaker 4
So as if it's the photos. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
This is LG there for? I'm in the G05. Hello. This is. The alleged injury that you caused so.
Speaker 4
What? What is it? Please point out to me what? What injury?
Speaker 2
This is This is just what.
Speaker 4
The the opposite. Yeah, but it looks just like a normal cheek. Yeah, I understand. Oh my God.
Speaker 2
And then this is in return at Alba LG05 does.
Speaker 4
Scuffed her elbow. So I've what have I done? It's just dragged over. I know it's allegation, but come on. If you're a police officer, you go there one I'm not there 2 she's intoxicated.
Speaker 2
So are you saying you didn't cause these injuries? No, I haven't. That's fine. And then it's also been reported at the end of August that you punched Lisa with full force, causing her nose to bleed. Did you do?
Speaker 4
This.
Speaker 2
Why was Lisa accused Your best if it's not true, recommend. Did you do this intentionally?
Speaker 4
My commands.
Speaker 2
I'm going to show you exhibit LG01LG02 and LG03. These are pictures of entry that Lisa got her nose and face. So this is Algae 01. And then Algae 02 and algae 03. No comment. OK, just these. To me, these do look quite serious.
Speaker 4
And dress. They would be quite serious if you were ****** *** and fell off a double. Drop curb and face down to the floor, OK?
Speaker 2
Is that is that what happened?
Speaker 4
Say no comments. I'm not trying to be awkward with you. Do you know what I mean? Do you know the situation, What's happened at that hour? Ever since that's happened, it's almost like a drink is getting out of control. Write me a funny as my baby mum. Why would I want to hurt my baby mum? You people probably couldn't hear it all the time. They're 16 years between me and Lisa. I've took her under 3 kids and all I have understood by it. Now, because all of a sudden I'm putting my foot down 'cause Morgan's created this whole situation at the house, the window got put through again a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, it's just as more added pressure all the time. Why would I want to do that to to a person who I love and is my baby mum? Yeah. When the whole house got shot up and I still stood there now, yeah.
Speaker 2
Would you, would you say that Morgan's creating attention in the air?
Speaker 4
Of course he is 100% of us.
Speaker 2
And is that because of the stuff that he is involved himself?
Speaker 4
With everything, it's not the only time he ever rings up. So basically. So basically with Lisa, yeah, every time he rings up all he. Wants is money, yeah. And I basically said to us, and I'm not being with us, you can't keep giving money I give you for hours and to give to him yeah, but look at what he's causing. It's almost like in my head like. I'm going there. Well done. OK.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 4
I ain't being funny if all this was taken last night. Yeah, she was rat ***** last night.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 4
Oh you took a statement off me full blown sober.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 4
I'm not I'm not trying to be awkward. You know, I'm not like that when I come and spoke to in a pastor. I'm not awkward like. MMM.
Speaker 2
Is there anything else you want to add?
Speaker 4
No, OK.
Speaker 2
Obviously I know you said no comment and given your prepared statement, but you've also stated to me that. You believe, Well, you said Lisa is alleging these allegations because she's unhappy with you putting your foot down because of her relationship with her son Morgan.
Speaker 4
Well, it's not about her relationship with her son Morgan. It's about the whole situation while her. Son has caused. Yeah, OK. It's not every day you think that sunscreen when you ask your husband has been shot up. Yeah. Then when he her when he gets put through again a couple weeks ago and Joe happened nothing, nothing with 25 bits. And we get off the phone today, so I got arrested. Getting off the phone.
Speaker 2
The time is 1234 and that's the end of the interview.

PRE-PREPARED STATEMENT

DATE:	28/09/25
TIME:		12.12
CLIENT:	Craig Johns
POLICE STATION:	Worcester PS
INSTRUCTING SOLICITORS:	JP Legal Solicitors 


This pre prepared statement has been scribed by Legal Representative Mr Riaz and is on my instruction.  These are my own words and is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.  

Mr Riaz has explained my legal rights and the options available to me, namely that I can answer all questions and provide a full account, put forward a pre prepared statement, or conduct a no comment interview where I answer some or no questions put to me.  I understand that this is simply advice and any decision I make is of my own volition.  I understand the implications of not answering questions or answering “no comment” to questions.  This being that should the matter proceed forward, and I fail to answer a question that I could have reasonably answered here today, the court may draw an inference.

	•	I Deny the allegation(s) made against me; I have not committed the alleged offence(s) of s47 ABH assault.
	•	I can confirm that I have not assaulted Lisa Gregson in any way, shape, shape, or form, on any date, at any location, at any time.
	•	I can confirm that on 27/09/25 I have not put my hands around her neck at 42 Stratford Rd, I have not restricted her breathing in any way.  I have not bitten her on the cheek and I certainly have not attempted to damage her phone in any way. I have not caused her to sustain any injuries, I certainly have not caused any cut or bruise on her elbow.
	•	I can confirm that I have not assaulted Lisa at the end of August at 42 Starford rd, or any other location for that matter. I have not punched her to the face, I have not caused her to sustain any injuries, I certainly have not caused her nose to bleed or any bruising to her eyes.
	•	These allegations are all false.
	•	I believe that Lisa is making these false allegations due to a recent disagreement that we have had and her intoxicated state at the time of making the statement.
	•	I will be answering no Comment to all further questions.
