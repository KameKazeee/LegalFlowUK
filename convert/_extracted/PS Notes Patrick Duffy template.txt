CASE SUMMARY

Mitchell is a very polite and respectful man. He was asked to attend the police station today (07/10/25) to participate in a voluntary interview after he was stopped when entering the Creamfields Festival in Cheshire on Friday 22 August. 
It is alleged that Mitchell had approximately 40 tablets and a quantity of cannabis on him (thought to be about 3 grams) when he tried to enter the festival, and because of the “find” Mitchell was refused entry and his details obtained so that the voluntary interview could be arranged. Cheshire Police only arrest for drugs offences at Creamfields when the person’s details cannot be confirmed or where the “find” is much more significant; they simply would not have the cell space or manpower to deal with everybody if they arrested everybody found to be in possession of controlled drugs. 

Unfortunately, the interview could not go ahead today. Cheshire Police had suffered an IT issue and their systems had “gone down”, meaning they were not able to record any interviews on the digital equipment. I did make representations for alternatives, like using bodycam, or just providing the police with a written statement, but the OIC’s supervision had said that she must conduct a proper interview, and they are no longer allowed to use bodycam to record them, so a new date will have to be set. 

The officer dealing is PC 37179 Victoria Adamson.
